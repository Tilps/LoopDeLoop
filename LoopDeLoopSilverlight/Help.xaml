            LoopDeLoop is a puzzle where the aim is to create a single looping line which passes through the sides around each number exactly the number of times specified.
</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>The line may not cross itself at point, so each intersection has at most 2 line segments meeting.
</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph></Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>To draw the line, use the left mouse button.  Using the right mouse button or double-clicking will draw a cross to mark where you think the line does not go.  The mouse buttons will also cycle between line, cross and empty when you use them in a place that has already been modified.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are a number of keyboard shortcuts you may find useful.  Ctrl-Z for undo, Ctrl-Y for redo.  Ctrl-F to lock the current position, Ctrl-U to unlock the current position, and Ctrl-M (or Ctrl-R if not IE) to reset to the previously locked position.
